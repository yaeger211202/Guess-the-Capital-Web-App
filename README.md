Description:
This project is a cloud-deployed web application called "Guess the Capital," where users are asked to guess the capital of a country from four choices. It was developed and deployed using Docker, IBM Cloud, and IBM Code Engine to gain hands-on experience in cloud computing, containerization, and serverless deployment.

Objectives:
•	Clone the source code.

•	Build and containerize the application using Docker.

•	Tag and push the Docker image to IBM Cloud Container Registry.

•	Deploy the application on IBM Code Engine for efficient, serverless hosting.

Technologies Used:

•	Cloud Platform: IBM Cloud, IBM Code Engine

•	Containerization: Docker

•	Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

•	DevOps: Docker, Continuous Deployment, CI/CD

•	Other Tools: IBM Cloud Container Registry

Features:
•	A user-friendly web application that tests users on the capitals of various countries.

•	Seamless deployment using Docker containers and serverless technology for scalability.

•	Steps to Run:

•	Clone the repository to your local machine.

•	Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.

•	Push the image to IBM Cloud Container Registry.

•	Deploy the containerized app on IBM Code Engine.


Skills Gained:

•	Cloud computing and cloud deployment using IBM Cloud and IBM Code Engine.

•	Containerization and Docker for app packaging and deployment.

•	Practical knowledge of serverless technologies and scalable cloud infrastructure.

•	Familiarity with continuous integration and deployment workflows.
